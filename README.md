📌 Project Description

Contract Analysis & Risk Assessment Bot is a GenAI-powered legal assistant designed to help small and medium businesses understand complex contracts and avoid hidden legal risks.

The system automatically processes uploaded contracts (PDF/DOCX), extracts clauses, identifies obligations and liabilities, and evaluates risk using NLP and large language models. Each clause is explained in simple business language, risky terms are highlighted, and safer alternatives are suggested.

It provides:

• Clause-level and contract-level risk scoring
• Plain-language summaries
• Compliance checks
• Renegotiation suggestions
• Multilingual support (English & Hindi)
• Exportable legal reports

This reduces manual legal review time from hours to seconds while improving contract transparency and decision-making for SMEs.
